To do:

changes:



plots:

*@ V @* - Richness graph that shows the number of unique species in each depth interval.
requires to sum the number of unique species names in each depth interval - on the long format.
* to make sure I am not counting species twice 


- checking the nestedness of the species over the depth gradient 
*-* support for the mid domain effect (random) or ecological constrains?

- mean depth distribution over depth - depth ranges - shahar does it but check it anyways

- rarefaction plots for the 3 mrchanisms
