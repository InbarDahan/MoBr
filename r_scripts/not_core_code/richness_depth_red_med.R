    # depths: (for now it's values but maybe I shoud trasform to bins of 10 m)

# a variable that indicate from which column the species list start:
first_species = 7 #the column form which the species list begin in wide_day2 dataset. 4,if we use the regular wide_day

# _______________________________________________________________

# subset our data to create the *species matrix data frame*, which we will call sp_matrix:

# checking the minimum number of records in a sample (opcode)

# _______________________________________________________________

# when we rarefy by sample, we may see an extremely low individual count. Rarefying to a low number such as *2* isnâ€™t really helpful.
# lets observe how abundance varies in our data set:
sp_matrix %>% 
  mutate(abundance = rowSums(.)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = abundance)+
  geom_histogram()+
  scale_x_log10() # for clarity

# _______________________________________________________________

# We will remove these samples for this demonstration and stay only with samples that have more than *10* individuals

# filter low abundance samples

# some samples have extremely low abundances (o). 
# We will remove these samples and stay only with samples that have more than *9* individuals
wide_opCode_clean = wide_opCode %>%

# create a new sp_matrix based on the filtered df:

# check lowest abundance count now:
